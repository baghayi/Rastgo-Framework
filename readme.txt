Introduction:
Rastgo-Framework is a php MVC-based framewrok that the goal behind it was to make a base for my projects and to learn how to deal with frameworks and learning new tips while developing it.

This Framework has no copyright ( or even copyleft :) ) and you can do everything with it with having no worries.

The news for this project will be write in it's facebook page: (http://www.facebook.com/pages/Rastgo-Framework-%D9%81%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%DA%A9-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D9%88/227954953929545)
But in our own language (Farsi), because I do believe that there are lots of Frameworks that are in english and I do not want to go with them, instead I want to put my all energy to make Farsi tutotials and video tutorials for this Framework, then the people only know farsi end not English well (Like me) can use it or even learn something with it.
